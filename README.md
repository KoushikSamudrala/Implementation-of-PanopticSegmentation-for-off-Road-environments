# Off-Road Panoptic Segmentation 
This project is about the generation of a baseline network for predicting panoptic segmentation results on the input forest image using a deep learning model, that is trained using Detectron2 network architecture of PanopticFPN model using custom dataset of RPTU Forest Panoptic Dataset.



## Installation
1. Detectron2 environment setup
     
* We need to setup an environment in which detectron2 is installed with all the essential libraries needed for our project. Follow the install instructions as per: 


```bash
https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/builtin_datasets.html
```

API Documentation for accessing detectron2 submodules and projects can be found at:

```bash
https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/index.html
```

The Dataset used for this project can be found under the following link:

```bash
